# goit-markup-hw-08

My first pet project under the careful guidance of a mentor from GOIT. I am very grateful for the help and what I have achieved in a short period of time.

Most importantly:
1. I fully learned to develop website layout, mastered HTML, CSS, SASS and a little bit of JS.
2. The site is completely made and adapted to mobile, tablet and desktop version.
3. mastered the technology BEM, positioning, Flexbox and decorative effects with a delay for better visibility.
